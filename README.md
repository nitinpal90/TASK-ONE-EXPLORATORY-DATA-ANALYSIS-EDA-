Discription:
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The analysis leverages Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal of this EDA is to understand the dataset's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers, and to gain insights that could be useful for further analysis or predictive modeling.

Steps Involved:
• Setup Environment: Import necessary libraries and set up the visualization style.
• Load Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
• Understand Dataset: Inspect the dataset structure, summary statistics, and data types.
• Check for Missing Values: Identify and quantify missing values.
• Visualize Distributions: Plot histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical columns.
• Analyze Categorical Variables: Use count plots to analyze categorical variables.
• Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize correlations between numeric variables using a heatmap.
• Scatter Plots and Pair Plots: Explore relationships between numerical variables with scatter and pair plots.
• Detect Outliers: Identify outliers using box plots.
• Summary and Insights: Summarize findings and key insights from the analysis.

Conclusion
The exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset revealed several interesting insights:

• Dataset Overview: The dataset contains 891 rows and 15 columns, including features such as age, fare, passenger class, and survival status.
• Missing Values: There are missing values in columns such as 'age', 'embarked', and 'deck', which require imputation or special handling.
• Distribution Insights: The age and fare distributions are skewed and contain outliers, indicating variability in passenger demographics and ticket prices.
• Categorical Analysis: The majority of passengers were male, and most traveled in the Third Class. Survival rates were higher for females and First-Class passengers.
• Correlation Findings: There is a strong correlation between passenger class (Pclass) and fare, indicating that higher-class tickets were more expensive.
• Visualization Insights: Scatter plots and pair plots show distinct patterns in survival rates based on age, fare, and class.
• Outliers: Outliers in the age and fare columns suggest the presence of extreme values that could affect modeling.
